Back in September 2024 I dust it off my _really_ old [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) that was tucked in my closet for more years that I care to admit. At the time I thought to myself "maybe I can install some simulators and play all sort of retro games on it!" and that thought alone was enough to me to make the purchase. However, it didn't take long to give up on the idea when I had to figure out all the other steps to make it work: how to install the OS on a micro SD card, buying a power supply that would work and so on.

You see, the idea of building something new was really interesting to me, but all the work around it was so overwhelming that I didn't even bother to start. Specifically, I had the hardest time thinking about the hardware: I had the board in my hands, but no easy way to turn it on and just starting hacking on it. This tiny SBC was so close to be similar to a PC but it lacked the fundamental parts that I always took for granted -- like, where is the power button on this thing???

The final nail in the coffin was, now that I think about it, the lack of reason to have a Raspberry Pi. I had an old laptop that basically met all my needs at the time, even gaming was pretty reasonable. So, unsurprisingly, to the shadow realm of my closet it went.

Last year I started getting into the idea of having a small server that I could host a couple of personal projects. And different from that time, now I kinda know what I am doing and what I can achieve with it! More importantly, I have a ton more resources to learn from.

The rest of September was filled with purchases to give life to my little board. The start of October was realizing that a Raspberry Pi 3 is really a product of its time and having a Quad Core CPU and 1GB of RAM wouldn't be nearly enough to do what I wanted. And thus my home lab journey begun!

Looking back, I had so much trouble(shooting) even getting started that a more reasonable person might ask "this does _not_ look enjoyable at all, isn't the point of a hobby to be fun?" And for that, I kinda think it is missing the point -- is not really about being easy or fun, having a hobby is understanding that the hardship that you go through is for yourself. It is very hard to learn a new skill or to engage in a new activity, it might be tiring or even discouraging, but at the end of the day you are claiming a piece of your time for you. Even if it wasn't your cup of tea, you can simply stop and find something new: it is not something that we can afford in most aspects of our lives.

So, yes. Having hobbies is hard, finding them is even harder. But the troubles that I go through is why I think they are worth.
